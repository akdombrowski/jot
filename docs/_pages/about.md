jwt-authn is an npm package for dealing with JSON Web Tokens ([JWT]((https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519))). Encoding, decoding, verifying, signing, and more coming. It includes support for the RS256 and HS256 algorithms and JWK and PEM format keys (even encrypted keys). Only Node >=15.x and a single small npm package as dependencies!

Now with command line support!
